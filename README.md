## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following before setting up the project:

- Python: Version 3.8 or later is recommended.
- Streamlit: Used to run the web application.
- Other Python packages as required (e.g., for data processing, AI models, etc.)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

 #### 1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/stock-market-ai-agent.git
   cd stock-market-ai-agent
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies:

```bash
    pip install streamlit
    # pip install any-other-required-packages
```

## Configuration

The project uses a secret management system provided by Streamlit. To securely handle API keys and the other sensitive configuration:

#### 1. .streamlit Folder:
- The ```.streamlit ``` directory holds configuration files including ```secrets.toml``` file.
- This file contain all secret parameters such as API keys.

#### 2. Setting Up secrets.toml:
- Navigate to the ```.streamlit``` folder and create or update the secrets.toml file:
- Example Configuration:
``` toml
  [api]
  key = "your_api_key_here"
```

#### 3. Security:
- The ```.gitignore``` file is set up to ensure that sensitive files (like ```secrest.toml```) are not pushed to the repository.
- Do not share your API key or other private information publicly.

## Running the Application
  
After installation and configuration, start the Streamlit web app with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run stock_market_ai_agent.py
```

This command will launch the application in your default web browser. Explore the interactive features and witness the AI agent in action.
